# Bernie FitzGerald

One quick note is that I've not worked with graphql before. My implementation is probably a little lacking when it comes to caching, optimisation etc... but was enough to get this task complete.

For the rest of the app I tried showing some usages of things like tests, jsdoc, splitting the app up into reasonable components etc... but not in an exhaustive way for the test.

Thanks!
